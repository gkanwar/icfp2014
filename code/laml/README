To compile a LaML program, use the helper compile.sh, which outputs on stdout:
./compile.sh file1.laml file2.laml > out.gcc

Currently importing laml files from within one another is not supported.
Instead, you must pass in the laml files in order of dependencies (i.e. if
file1.laml is needed for file2.laml, then file1.laml should be passed first).
The code is basically just concatenated together and compiled as one large
chunk of code.
